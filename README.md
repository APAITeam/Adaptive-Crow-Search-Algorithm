# Adaptive-Crow-Search-Algorithm

This is the source code of Adaptive crow search algorithm (ACSA) written in MATLAB.

The Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the intelligent behavior of crows. While CSA demonstrates remarkable performance in solving optimization problems, the balance between exploration and exploitation is influenced by a fixed awareness probability. This static value can lead the algorithm to become trapped in local optima. we aim to address this issue by introducing the Adaptive Crow Search Algorithm (ACSA), which dynamically adjusts the awareness probability during the algorithm's execution. The performance of ACSA was evaluated by comparing it with several other meta-heuristic algorithms, demonstrating its superior capabilities. Furthermore, ACSA was successfully applied to solve three constrained optimization problems, showcasing its effectiveness in diverse scenarios. The results highlight the significant performance improvement achieved by ACSA when compared to the other algorithms.
